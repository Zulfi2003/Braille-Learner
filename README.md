# Braille Learner

## Introduction
The "Braille Learner" project is an innovative educational solution designed to empower individuals learning Braille by offering a multi-sensory learning experience. It combines tactile and auditory feedback to enhance the comprehension and retention of Braille characters, ultimately facilitating the journey to Braille literacy.

## Features   
- Interactive web interface for selecting Braille letters
- Tactile feedback through a Braille grid with servo motors
- Auditory feedback using Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology
- Comprehensive hardware and software integration
- User-friendly design for intuitive learning experience
- Customizable and scalable for individual needs

## Components Used
The "Braille Learner" project utilizes the following components:
- Node MCU development board
- Servo motors
- Gears (linear and circular)
- Speaker
- Transistors
- Web interface components
- Braille grid and mounting hardware
- Power supply (6V seal lead battery)
- Casing

## Installation
To set up the "Braille Learner" project, follow these steps:
1. Assemble the hardware components according to the provided instructions.
2. Upload the software code to the Node MCU development board.
3. Connect the servo motors, speaker, and power supply to the Node MCU.
4. Set up the web interface on a compatible web server.
5. Ensure proper calibration of the hardware components for accurate feedback.

## Usage
Once the "Braille Learner" project is set up, users can:
1. Access the web interface to select Braille letters they want to learn.
2. Receive tactile feedback through the Braille grid as servo motors simulate Braille characters.
3. Listen to auditory feedback as selected letters are pronounced using Text-to-Speech technology.
4. Engage in a comprehensive and interactive learning experience combining touch and sound.
