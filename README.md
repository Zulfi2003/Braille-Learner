# Braille Learner: A Multi-Sensory Braille Learning Experience

## Introduction
The "Braille Learner" project is an innovative educational solution designed to empower individuals learning Braille. By combining tactile and auditory feedback, it enhances the comprehension and retention of Braille characters. This project addresses the challenge of making Braille learning more interactive and accessible, ultimately facilitating the journey to Braille literacy for visually impaired individuals.

## Features
- **Interactive web interface** for selecting Braille letters
- **Tactile feedback** through a Braille grid controlled by servo motors
- **Auditory feedback** using Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology
- **Comprehensive hardware-software integration**
- **User-friendly design** that supports intuitive learning
- **Customizable** for different learning needs
- **Scalable design** for individual or group use

## Components Used
The "Braille Learner" project utilizes the following components:
- Node MCU development board (https://components101.com/wireless/esp8266-pinout-configuration-features-datasheet)
- Servo motors (http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/pcheung/teaching/DE1_EE/stores/sg90_datasheet.pdf)
- Gears (linear and circular) 
- Speaker
- Transistors
- Web interface components
- Braille grid and mounting hardware
- Power supply (6V sealed lead-acid battery)
- Casing

## Installation
### Hardware Setup
1. Assemble the hardware components according to the provided instructions.
2. Connect the servo motors, speaker, and power supply to the Node MCU.

### Software Setup
1. Upload the provided software code to the Node MCU development board.
2. Set up the web interface on a compatible web server using [installation guide/link].
3. Ensure proper calibration of the hardware components for accurate feedback.

## Usage
1. Access the web interface through your browser to select the Braille letters you want to learn.
2. Upon selection, the corresponding Braille characters will be simulated on the tactile Braille grid, driven by the servo motors.
3. Simultaneously, the system will pronounce the selected Braille letter using Text-to-Speech technology for auditory feedback.
4. Continue engaging with more letters to enhance your learning experience.
